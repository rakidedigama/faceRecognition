# faceRecognition
This Project uses the OpenCV FaceRecognizer class along with Haar Cascade classifier for Face recongition and detection, respectively. 
The FaceClassifier class abstracts the FaceRecognizer class with the ability to change type of classifier (based on features- eigenface,
fisherfaces or LHBP)
